 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/hewenyuann19930327/ZYH.Operation.Sys.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Chapter 45. Forcing git fetch to do non-fast-forward updates
If git fetch fails because the new head of a branch is not a descendant of the old head, you may force the update with:

$ git fetch git://example.com/proj.git +master:refs/remotes/example/master
Note the addition of the + sign. Alternatively, you can use the -f flag to force updates of all the fetched branches, as in:

$ git fetch -f origin
Be aware that commits that the old version of example/master pointed at may be lost, as we saw in the previous section.
